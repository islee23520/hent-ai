# Hent-ai for OpenClaw

Emotion Image Attachment Plugin for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).

Automatically classifies the emotion of every bot response using LLM and attaches a matching emotion image to Discord messages.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) installed and running
- A Discord bot token (provide via env var or plugin config — see [Discord Bot Token](#discord-bot-token))
- An LLM provider configured in OpenClaw for emotion classification
- **Emotion images** — You need at least 6 PNG images, one for each emotion. Generate or create your own images and name them:
   - `happy.png`
   - `neutral.png`
   - `loyalty.png`
   - `sorry.png`
   - `confused.png`
   - `focused.png`

   Place them in the `assets/` directory inside the plugin, or set a custom `imageDir` in the config.
   You can also add multiple pre-labeled images per emotion and configure `emotionMap` as an image pool; the plugin randomly selects one variant each time that emotion is shown.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
cd /path/to/your/openclaw/extensions
git clone https://github.com/IYENTeam/Hent-ai.git emotion-image
```

Or install to the OpenClaw global extensions directory:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/extensions
git clone https://github.com/IYENTeam/Hent-ai.git emotion-image
```

### Step 2: Generate Emotion Images

Place 6 emotion images in the `assets/` directory:

```
assets/
├── happy.png
├── neutral.png
├── loyalty.png
├── sorry.png
├── confused.png
└── focused.png
```

See the main [README.md](../README.md#creating-emotion-images) for generation methods (CLI auto-generate or manual creation).

### Step 3: Configure OpenClaw

Add the plugin configuration to your `openclaw.json` (or via `openclaw config`):

```jsonc
{
   "plugins": {
     "entries": {
       "emotion-image": {
         "enabled": true,
         "config": {
           // Required: Discord bot token. Use "${ENV_VAR}" to interpolate from environment.
           "discordToken": "${EMOTION_IMAGE_DISCORD_TOKEN}",

           // Required: provider/model ID for LLM-based emotion classification
           "classifierModel": "your-provider/gpt-5.4-mini",

           // Optional: custom image directory (defaults to ../assets/ relative to the plugin)
           // "imageDir": "/path/to/custom/assets",

           // Optional: override default emotion (defaults to "neutral")
           // "defaultEmotion": "neutral",
           // Optional: channel-level on/off policy. Overrides are Discord channel IDs.
           // "channels": {
           //   "defaultEnabled": true,
           //   "overrides": {
           //     "123456789012345678": false
           //   }
           // },


            // Optional: override emotion-to-filename mapping or define labeled image pools
            // "emotionMap": {
            //   "happy": "happy.png",
            //   "neutral": "neutral.png",
            //   "focused": [
            //     { "file": "focused-coding.png", "label": "coding" },
            //     { "file": "focused-reading.png", "label": "reading", "weight": 2 }
            //   ]
            // }
         }
       }
     }
   }
 }
 ```

### Step 4: Build and Restart OpenClaw

If running from source:

```bash
cd /path/to/openclaw
pnpm run build
```

Then restart OpenClaw:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Step 5: Verify

After restart, check the gateway log for:

```
[plugins] emotion-image: LLM classifier enabled with model="your-provider/gpt-5.4-mini"
[plugins] emotion-image: token found (len=XX), imageDir=/path/to/assets
```

Send a message in Discord. You should see:
1. A "focused" thinking image appears immediately
2. The bot responds with text
3. An emotion image is appended to the response

## Configuration Reference

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable/disable the plugin |
| `discordToken` | `string` | — | Discord bot token. Supports literal value or `${ENV_VAR}` placeholder. Required. |
| `classifierModel` | `string` | — | OpenClaw `provider/model` ID for LLM classification. **Required for LLM mode.** If not set, uses rule-based keyword matching only. |
| `imageDir` | `string` | profile workspace `.hent-ai/emotion-image-assets`, then `../assets` fallback | Directory containing emotion image files |
| `defaultEmotion` | `string` | `"neutral"` | Fallback emotion when no match found |
| `channels.defaultEnabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Default enabled state for channels without explicit overrides |
| `channels.overrides` | `object` | `{}` | Discord channel ID → boolean enable/disable overrides |
| `emotionMap` | `object` | (built-in) | Mapping from emotion name → image filename or labeled image pool. **Filenames only** — paths that escape `imageDir` are rejected. |
| `emotionRules` | `object` | (built-in) | Custom keyword regex patterns per emotion (merged with defaults) |
| `cheer.enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable one-off cheer image generation |
| `cheer.intentModel` | `string` | `classifierModel` | Optional provider/model ID for detecting cheer/support request intent |
| `cheer.character` | `string` | — | Optional character description for cheer images; otherwise `base.png` is used as reference when available |
| `cheer.model` | `string` | — | Optional provider/model ID for cheer image generation |
| `cheer.size` | `string` | `"1024x1024"` | Generated cheer image dimensions |

## How It Works

Hent-ai operates in two phases:

1. **Phase 1 — Thinking Indicator** (`message_received` hook)
    - When a user sends a message, the plugin immediately sends a "focused" (thinking) image to the channel
    - This gives instant visual feedback before the bot responds
    - If the user's message asks for encouragement/support (for example `나 응원해줘` or `오늘 너무 힘든데 기운 좀 줘`), the plugin generates and sends a tasteful non-explicit cheer image instead
    - Cheer intent detection requires `classifierModel` or `cheer.intentModel`; without a configured GPT/provider model, cheer requests will not trigger image generation

2. **Phase 2 — Emotion Classification** (`message_sent` hook)
   - After the bot sends a response, the plugin calls an LLM to classify the emotion of the response text
   - The classified emotion image is appended to the bot's message
   - If LLM classification fails, falls back to rule-based keyword matching

## Architecture

```
User message
  │
  ├─► [message_received hook]
  │     ├─► If LLM detects cheer/support intent: generate + send cheer image
  │     └─► Otherwise send focused.png to channel (instant)
  │
  ▼
Bot generates response
  │
  ├─► [message_sent hook]
  │     ├─► LLM classifies emotion (background, up to 15s timeout with 1 retry)
  │     ├─► Falls back to rule-based if LLM fails
  │     └─► Appends emotion image to bot message via Discord PATCH
  │
  ▼
User sees: [focused.png] → [text response + emotion.png]
```

## Image Generation Limits

All image generation calls (onboarding, cheer, miracle mode) enforce the following:

- **Maximum 3 reference images** per request. Exceeding this throws an error.
- **Auto-resize**: Reference images larger than 768px (either dimension) are automatically resized before sending, preserving aspect ratio. This prevents request timeouts.
- **90-second timeout**: If the backend doesn't respond within 90s, the request fails with a timeout error.
- **Safety rephrase**: When `classifierModel` is configured, prompts rejected by the content-policy filter are automatically rephrased by the session's LLM provider and retried (up to 3 total attempts). If all attempts fail, the original error is reported.

## Private Mode (Per-Channel Set Switching)

Hent-ai supports per-channel asset set switching via an agent-driven skill. The agent reads `skills/private-mode.SKILL.md` and executes a script to toggle the active image set for a channel.

### How it works

1. User says "private 모드 켜줘"
2. Agent reads the skill file and executes:
   ```bash
   npx tsx openclaw/scripts/set_channel_mode.ts --channel <CHANNEL_ID> --mode private
   ```
3. The script writes to `imageDir/hentai.db` (`channel_settings.asset_set_id`)
4. On the next emotion image request, the plugin reads the DB setting and uses `imageDir/sets/private/` assets

### Setup

1. Create a `private` set in your image directory:
   ```
   imageDir/sets/private/
   ├── happy.png
   ├── neutral.png
   ├── loyalty.png
   ├── sorry.png
   ├── confused.png
   └── focused.png
   ```

2. Register it in `manifest.json` (or use the CLI/onboarding to generate)

3. Ensure the agent has access to `skills/private-mode.SKILL.md`

### Persistence

Channel asset-set overrides are saved to `imageDir/hentai.db` (`channel_settings.asset_set_id`) and persist across bot restarts. Legacy `channel-overrides.json` is still read as a fallback.

### Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `--mode private` | Switch channel to `private` set |
| `--mode default` | Revert channel to global default set |
| `--mode <any-set-id>` | Switch to any registered set |

## Discord Bot Token

Provide the Discord bot token via one of:

1. **Environment variable** (recommended for production):
   ```bash
   export EMOTION_IMAGE_DISCORD_TOKEN="your-bot-token"
   ```

2. **Plugin config with env interpolation**:
   ```jsonc
   "discordToken": "${EMOTION_IMAGE_DISCORD_TOKEN}"
   ```

3. **Plugin config with literal value** (not recommended — keep tokens out of config files):
   ```jsonc
   "discordToken": "your-bot-token"
   ```

If neither is set, the plugin logs a warning and does nothing.

> **⚠️ v2 BREAKING CHANGE**: Earlier versions of this plugin auto-resolved the
> token by reading `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` directly. That fallback has been
> removed for security and portability — plugins should not read host-internal
> config paths. If you were relying on the auto-detect behavior, set
> `EMOTION_IMAGE_DISCORD_TOKEN` or `discordToken` explicitly.

## Onboarding (Agent-Driven)

Onboarding is handled by the OpenClaw agent reading this document and the repository state. There is no coded state machine, fixed questionnaire, or plugin intent detector for onboarding. The agent should infer what it can from the user's request, existing files, attached images, and config, then ask only for information that blocks progress.

### How It Works

When `imageDir` is omitted, Hent-ai stores assets under the active OpenClaw profile/workspace at `.hent-ai/emotion-image-assets`. This keeps gateway profiles from sharing or overwriting each other's emotion assets. Set `imageDir` explicitly only when you intentionally want a shared asset directory.

### Trigger

When a user says `onboarding`, `setup`, or asks to create/configure a character in Discord, the OpenClaw agent should treat this section as an operating guide, not a script. A typical flow is:

1. **Understand the character goal** — Infer the character concept from the user's message, attachments, and existing project files. Ask one concise question only if the concept is missing or ambiguous.

2. **Handle attached images** — If the user attaches an image, use context to decide whether it is the base character, a style reference, or a replacement for an emotion image. Ask only when the choice is ambiguous.

3. **Generate or install the base character** — Use `image_generate` when generation is needed, or save/copy a provided image when the user already supplied the asset. Show generated results and get approval before treating one as canonical.
   - If the user approves → proceed to emotions
   - If the user gives feedback → regenerate with feedback incorporated
   - If the user says cancel/취소/종료 → abort

4. **Create the emotion set** — Ensure these 6 emotions exist: `happy`, `neutral`, `loyalty`, `sorry`, `confused`, `focused`.
   - Generate using the base image as reference, or use user-provided replacements
   - Preserve character identity and style consistency
   - Get approval at meaningful checkpoints; do not force a fixed one-question-per-emotion script when the user already gave enough direction
   - Save approved files to the configured asset directory

5. **Verify and complete** — Confirm the expected files exist in the active asset/profile directory and tell the user the plugin is ready.

### Agent Prompting Guidelines

For base character generation:
```
[user's character description], clean illustration style, square format, simple background, high quality PNG
```

For emotion variants (use base image as reference):
```
Same character as the reference image, expressing [emotion].
[emotion-specific cues]. Simple background, consistent art style.
```

Emotion cues:
- `happy` — smiling, celebrating, thumbs up
- `neutral` — calm, relaxed, default expression
- `loyalty` — saluting, nodding, attentive
- `sorry` — apologetic, bowing, sheepish
- `confused` — head tilt, question mark, puzzled
- `focused` — concentrating, working, determined

### File Output

Save all generated images to the configured `imageDir` (default: `../assets/` relative to the plugin):
- `base.png` — the base character
- `happy.png`, `neutral.png`, `loyalty.png`, `sorry.png`, `confused.png`, `focused.png`

For profile/private mode onboarding, save into the active profile directory such as `imageDir/profiles/<profileId>/` instead of the root asset directory.

### Exit Commands

The user can abort at any time with: `취소`, `cancel`, `종료`, `그만`

### Labeled Image Pools

`emotionMap` can contain multiple custom images per emotion. Each image may have a `label`, and Hent-ai prefers variants whose label appears in the bot response context before falling back to weighted random selection:

```jsonc
{
  "emotionMap": {
    "happy": [
      { "file": "happy-stage.png", "label": "stage", "weight": 2 },
      { "file": "happy-date-night.png" }
    ]
  }
}
```

If `label` is omitted, Hent-ai infers one from the filename by removing the emotion word and common image terms. For example, `happy-date-night.png` becomes `date night`, so a response mentioning `date night` will automatically select that image when the classified emotion is `happy`.

## Troubleshooting

### Images not appearing
- Check `gateway.log` for `emotion-image:` entries
- Verify the bot has `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission in the Discord channel (needed for message PATCH)
- Ensure image files exist in the configured `imageDir`

### LLM classification always returns null
- Check `gateway.err.log` for timeout or API errors
- Verify the `classifierModel` provider is configured and has valid credentials
- Try increasing `LLM_TIMEOUT_MS` in `index.ts` (default: 15000ms)

### "Cannot edit a message authored by another user" (403)
- The plugin tried to edit a non-bot message. This is handled gracefully and logged as a warning.
